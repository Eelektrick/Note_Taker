# Issues

My issue my initial start to typing the code I tried to fit it all in one js.

But this looked messy and hard even for my self to follow clearly.

I seperated the code into 3 different js files

I kept forgetting to add extra . for my pathing and when trying to:

save, delete, or go to the notes.html nothing worked.

Had to re read every line of code and change variables from let and const and var.

I did this to make sure I was not causing errors myself.
